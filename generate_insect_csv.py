    "Is there any black moldy growth on the lesion?",
    "Does the disease affect the whole plant?",
    "Is the spot size more than 5mm in diameter?",
    "Are the lesions visible on both sides of the leaf?",
    "Is the infection found only on mature leaves?",
    "Are the leaf veins visible through the lesion?",
    "Is the damage uniform across the field?",
    "Was there previous history of Early Blight in this field?",
    "Is the farmer using resistant tomato varieties?",
    "Was any fungicide recently applied?",
    "Was there poor air circulation in the field?",
    "Was the field irrigated from overhead sprinklers?",
    "Are pruning and sanitation practices followed?",
    "Is there any other crop in the field showing similar spots?"
